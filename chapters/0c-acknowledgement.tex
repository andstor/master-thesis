\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
I wish to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Jingyue Li, for all the help and guidance throughout the entire project. I also want to acknowledge Ms. Tianyuan Hu for her help with vulnerability analysis. Finally, I want to acknowledge all the love and support from my family - my parents, Synnøve and Ove; and my sisters, Maria, Viktoria and Helene. This work would not have been possible without them.
