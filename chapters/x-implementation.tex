\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
This chapter introduces the necessary background information for this study. First, a brief introduction to blockchain technology is provided in \cref{sec:blockchain} and then the concept of \acrfullpl{sc} is introduced in \cref{sec:smart-contract}. Finally, in \cref{sec:smart-contract-vulnerabilities}, the most popular \acrshort{sc} vulnerabilities are described.

\subsection{Smart contract downloader}
\label{sec:smart-contract-downloader}
\url{https://github.com/andstor/smart-contract-downloader}


The largest provider of verified \acrshortpl{sc} is Etherscan. This website provides a list of all verified \acrshortpl{sc} on the blockchain. More on their service...... Etherscan provides a API for downloading verified Smart Contracts. The API is available at \url{https://api.etherscan.io/api}.

In order to download the \acrshortpl{sc} from Etherscan, a tool we need to provide the \acrshortpl{sc} address. The address is the first part of the \acrshortpl{sc} code. The address is the first part of the \acrshortpl{sc} code.

The following code snippet is a Google BigQuery query. It will select all \acrshortpl{sc} addresses on the Ethereum blockchain that has at least one transaction. This query was run on the 1st of April 2022, and the result was downloaded as a CSV file, and is available at \url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/andstor/smart_contracts/blob/main/contract_addresses.csv}. The CSV file is then used to download the \acrshortpl{sc} from Etherscan.

\begin{lstlisting}[
    caption={Google BigQuery query for selecting all \acrlong{sc} addresses on Ethereum that has at least one transaction.},
    label=lst:reentrancy,
    language=SQL]
SELECT contracts.address, COUNT(1) AS tx_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.contracts` AS contracts
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions` AS transactions 
      ON (transactions.to_address = contracts.address)
GROUP BY contracts.address
ORDER BY tx_count DESC
}
\end{lstlisting}

\todo{Include img of the processing script output}
Saved to file for simple reestarrting, multiprocessing and parallelization.

The total number of files generated by the downloading program was 5,810,042. In order to efficiently process these, all files were combined into a tarfile. A processing script was then created for filtering out all "empty" files. These correspond to a contract address on Ethereum that has not been verified on Etherscan.io. A total of 3,592,350 files were empty, making the source code of 38,17\% of the deployed contracts on Ethereum available. Each non-empty file is then parsed and the contract data is extracted. This extraction process is rather complicated, as smart contract sources come in a wide variety of flavors and formats.

\subsubsection{Normalization}
The most common is a contract written the Solidity language with  a single contract "entry"  \todo{Find a better name for contract keyword}. However, a single contrract file can contain multtiple contracts, making use of properties like inheritance etc.. The source code contracts can also be split over multiple files, a formmat rreefered to as "Multi file". When compiling thtese, the source code files aree "flattened" into a single contract file before compiliattion. Anotther flavour is hte JSON format, which is a language that is used to describe the \acrshortpl{sc}. Here the sourcecode is structured in tthe in the JSON code. Smart contracts can also be vritten in the Vyper language. Vyper is .... \todo{explain vyper}.


\begin{lstlisting}[
    caption={Solidity standard JSON Input format.},
    label=lst:flattened-dataset-cmd,
    language=JSON]
{
    "sources": {/* ... */},
    "settings": {
        "optimizer": {/* ... */},
        "evmVersion": "<VERSION>"
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

All of the above formats are processed by the processing script, normalizing the contract source code to a single "flattened" contract file. The source code, along with the contract metadata, is then saved across multiple Parquet files, each consisting of 30000 "flattened" contracts. A total of 2,217,692 smart contracts were successfully parsed and normalized.

\subsubsection{Duplication filtering}
\label{sec:duplication-filtering}
A large quantity of Smart Contracts contains duplicated code. Primarily, this is due to the frequent use of library code, such as Safemath and ... \todo{Reference libraries}. Etherscan requires the library code used in a contract to be embedded in the source code. Filtering is applied to produce a dataset with a mostly unique contract source code to mitigate this. This filtering is done by calculating the string distance between the source code. Due to the rather large amount of contracts (\~2 million), the comparison is only made within groups of contracts. These groups are defined by grouping on the "contract\_name" for the \textit{flattened} dataset, and by "file\_name" for the \textit{inflated} dataset. These datasets will be discssed in detail in the following sections.

The actual code filtering is done by applying a token-based similarity algorithm named Jacard Index. The algorithm is computationally efficient and can be used to filter out \acrshortpl{sc} that are not similar to the query. The Jacard Index is a measure of the similarity between two sets. The Jacard Index is defined as the ratio of the size of the intersection to the size of the union of the two sets.


\subsection{Datasets}
\label{sec:datasets}
This section describes the datasets used and created in this study.

\subsubsection{The Pile}
\label{sec:the-pile}
Describe the  PILE...  It consists of among others, a lot of data from GitHub. HHowever, only x\% of the data is smart contracts (Solidity). Hence there is a need for a dataset made up of smart contracts. --> existing datasets....

\subsubsection{Verified Smart Contracts}
\label{sec:verified-smart-contracts}
\url{https://github.com/andstor/verified-smart-contracts}
\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/andstor/smart_contracts}

The Verified Smart Contracts dataset is a dataset consisting of verified Smart Contracts from Etherscan.io. This is real smmart contracts that are deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. A set of 100,000 to 200,000 contracts are provided, containing both Solidity and Vyper code.

\cref{tab:verified-smart-contracts-metrics} shows the metrics of the various (sub)datasets.

\end{table}

LoC refers to the lines of source\_code. The Parsed dataset counts lines of func\_code + func\_documentation.

\paragraph{Raw}
\label{sec:verified-smart-contracts-raw}
The raw dataset contains mostly the raw data from Etherscan, downloaded with the smart-contract-downlader tool, as described in \cref{sec:smart-contract-downloader}. All different contract formats (JSON, multi-file, etc.) are normalized to a flattened source code structure. 

\todo{Add stats on the raw dataset}

\paragraph{Flattened}
\label{sec:verified-smart-contracts-flattened}

The flattened dataset is a filtered version  of the Raw dataset\cref{sec:verified-smart-contracts-raw}. It contains smart contracts, where every contract contains all required library code. Each "file" is marked in the source code with a comment stating the original file path: //File: path/to/file.sol. These are then filtered for uniqueness with a similarity threshold of 0.9. This means that all contracts whose code shares more than 90\% of the tokens will be discarded. The low uniqueness requirement is due to the often large amount of embedded library code. If the requirement is set to high, the actual contract code will be negligible compared to the library code. Most contracts will be discarded, and the resulting dataset would contain mostly unique library code. However, the dataset as a whole will have a large amount of duplicated libray code. From the 2,217,692 contracts, 2,080,723 duplications are found, giving a duplication percentage of 93.82\%. The resulting dataset consists of 136,969 contracts.

\paragraph{Inflated}
\label{sec:verified-smart-contracts-inflated}
The inflated dataset is also based on the raw dataset. Each contract file in the dataset is split into its original representative files. This mitigates a lot of the problems of the flattened dataset in terms of duplicated library code. The library code would, along with other imported contract files, be split into separate contract records. The 2,217,692 "raw" smart contracts are inflated to a total of 5,403,136 separate contract files. These are then grouped by "file\_name" and filtered for uniqueness with a similarity threshold of 0.9. This should produce a dataset with a large amount of unique source code, with low quantities of library code. A total of 5,216,739 duplications are found, giving a duplication percentage of 96.56\%. The resulting dataset consists of 186,397 contracts.

\section{Language Modeling}
\label{sec:language-modeling}
This chapter presents the results of this thesis. The chapter starts with ... the research questions defined in \cref{sec:research-questions}.

As discussed in section \cref{sec:transformers-for-code-synthesis}, there are several available transformer models. However, only a few of them have open-sourced pre-trained weights. Of these, only GPT-J \cite{gpt-j} includes code in it's pre-training dataset "The Pile", described in \cref{sec:the-pile}. As GPT-J is a state-of-the-art generative pre-trained transformer model, this is the language model used in this thesis. This chapter presents a detailed overview of the system architecture for generating secure Smart Contract code. The first section gives an overview of the GPT-J model architecture, followed by a section describing the pre-training of the model. The third section describes the fine-tuning process on the smart contract dataset presented in \cref{sec:verified-smart-contracts-inflated,sec:verified-smart-contracts-audit}. 

\todo{Add figure of training process}

\subsection{Model architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}
Ever since OpenAI introduced its first transformer model in the GPT series, this class of transformers has been touted as the state-of-the-art for text generation. Their latest model, GPT-3 \cite{brown2020language}, is their best performing model with 175 billion parameters. However, the model is not openly available at the current time. GPT-J \cite{gpt-j} with 6 billion parameters (GPT-J-6B) is currently one of the best open-source alternatives to OpenAI's GPT-3. GPT-J was released in June 2021 by EleutherAI \cite{elutherai}, a grassroots collection of researchers working to open-source AI research. The model is trained on the Pile, an 825 GiB diverse, open-source language modeling data set that consists of 22 smaller, high-quality datasets combined together. See section \cref{sec:the-pile} for a more detailed description of the Pile.

Being a GPT class transformer, GPT-J uses a decoder-only architecture, as can be seen in \cref{fig:gpt-j-architecture}. The GPT-J introduces some notable differences from standard transformer models. Firstly, instead of computing attention and feed-forward layers in sequential order, they are computed in parallel and the results are added together. This decreases communication during distributed training, resulting in increased throughput. Secondly, GPT-J uses \acrfull{rope} \cite{su2021roformer} for position encoding. Opposite to sinusoidal encoding used in standard transformer models (see \cref{sec:embedding-and-positional-encoding}), this is shown to result in better model quality in tasks with long text \cite{su2021roformer}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/gpt-j_architecture.pdf}
    \caption{Diagram of GPT-J model architecture}
    \label{fig:gpt-j-architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}
To load the GPT-J model in float32 precision, one would need at least 2x the model size of CPU RAM: 1x for the initial weights and another 1x to load the checkpoint. So for just loading the GPT-J model, it would require at least 48GB or CPU RAM. To reduce the memory footprint, one can load the model in half-precision.

GPU needs around 40GB of GPU memory to load the model. For training/fine-tuning the model, it would require significantly more GPU RAM. For example, the Adam optimizer makes four copies of the model: model, gradients, average and the squared average of gradients. Hence, it would take 4x model size GPU memory, even with mixed precision as gradient updates are in fp32. Further, this doesn't include the activations and data batches which would require some more GPU RAM. Hence, solutions like DeepSpeed needs to be used for training/fine-tuning such large models.

If a GPU with mixed precision capabilities (architecture Pascal or more recent) is available, one can use mixed precision training with PyTorch 1.6.0 or later, or by installing the Apex library for previous versions. If using an NVIDIA “Ampere” GPU architecture, the Brain Floting Point (BF16) floating-point format can be used. Using mixed precision training usually results in 2x-speedup for training with the same final results.

\subsection{Pre-training}
\label{sec:pretraining}
Pre-training is defined as "Training in advanced". By first training the model on a huge dataset, the model can then be fine-tuned on a much smaller dataset. This is so-called transfer learning. In this project, pre-trained weights for GPT-J-6B from ElutherAI are used. The pre-training by ElutherAI is done on the dataset The Pile, described in \cref{sec:the-pile}. Of the roughly 825GiB, 95.16 GiB (7.59\%) of The Pile is code from GitHub. Compared to many other open-source models, GPT-J-6B is one of the most promising models for the task of code generation.

The specific GPT-J model configuration can be seen in \cref{tab:gpt-j-model-details}. In detail, GPT-J-6B consists of 28 layers with a model dimension of 4096, and a feedforward dimension of 16384. The model dimension is split into 16 heads, each with a dimension of 256. \acrfull{rope} is applied to 64 dimensions of each head. The model is trained with a tokenization vocabulary of 50257, using the same set of \acrfullpl{bpe} as GPT-2 and GPT-3. The weights of GPT-J-6B are licensed under version 2.0 of the Apache License.

\subsection{Fine-tuning}
\label{sec:fine-tuning}
To improve the pre-trained GPT-J-6B model's smart contract code generation performance, the model is fine-tuned on a dataset only containing real Ethereum Smart Contract code. Specifically, two models are created. The first model, named GPT-J-6B-Smart-Contract, is fine-tuned on the Verified Smart Contracts dataset \cref{sec:verified-smart-contracts}. The other model, named GPT-J-6B-Smart-Contract-Audit, is a secure version of the first model. It is fine-tuned on the Verified Smart Contracts Audit dataset \cref{sec:verified-smart-contracts-audit}, the same dataset as for the first model but with additional labeling from vulnerability analysis.

\subsection{Security Conditioning}
\label{sec:security-conditioning}
When training a large language model on several gigabytes of open-source code, it is safe to assume that large portions of this code are not safe and contains vulnerabilities. In the case of Smart Contracts, the vulnerability analysis presented in section \ref{sec:verified-smart-contracts} shows that almost 50\% of deployed Smart Contracts contain at least one high-severity vulnerability. This will result in a biased model that may produce a lot of vulnerable code. This section introduces a technique, named security conditioning, to reduce and mitigate this problem.

Vulnerability analysis is a difficult area. It is especially hard in the area of smart contracts, where the execution environment is not deterministic ????\todo{find correct wording.}... Previous works have tried to classify vulnerable code with large language models without much success \todo{Cite previous works}. In this project, instead of classifying vulnerable code, the goal is to make the model more secure by conditioning it on the presence of vulnerabilities.

The security conditioning is done by appending a special security label to each of the records in the training data. This way, the model can use this token(s) to condition whether to produce safe or vulnerable code. This requires the dataset to first be labeled as secure or vulnerable. For this project, SolidityDetector is used for labeling. Further details on the dataset construction can be found in \cref{sec:verified-smart-contracts-audit}.
