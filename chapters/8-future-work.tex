The area of \acrshort{sc} vulnerability analysis and detection has already come a long way, even though the area of blockchain is still in its infancy. There are still many research gaps needing to be filled.


Use the model itself for clustering.

train model from scratch on only smart contract code.. Not possible  due to time and resource requirements.

Reduce model size with knowledge distillation

Faults in SoliDettector...

Future work, combine multiple vulnerability detectors

The area of vulnerability evaluation of code synthesis is 

An efficient and sound approach for automatically evaluating the security of synthesized code is lacking. Current sound solutions require a lot of manual effort. A custom vulnerability detection tool that could detect not just definite vulnerabilities, but also potential vulnerabilities could be an interesting solution and is left as future work.
