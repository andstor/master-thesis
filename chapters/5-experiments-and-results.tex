\chapter{Experiments and Results}
\label{chap:experiments-and-results}
This chapter presents the experiments and results that have been conducted. The data and language modeling process needed for all of the experiments is presented in the first two sections, respectively. Then, the experiments are presented one by one. 

The experiments are grouped by research question. Experiment \textbf{E1} takes on research question 1 regarding automatic smart contract code synthesis. Expand to \textbf(E1.1} and \textbf(E1.2}It explores the performance of a pre-trained transformer-based language model on the verified smart contract dataset. Experiment \textbf{E2} focuses on the security of smart contract code generation, tackling research question 2. It compares the security of a fine-tuned model utilizing security conditioning purposed in \cref{sec:security-conditioning}. This section presents three sub-experiments:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{E2.\arabic*.}, leftmargin=1.5cm]
    \item Compares security performance based on providing entire class context from audited verified smart contract dataset.
    \item Compares security performance based on using only comments as input context from audited verified smart contract dataset.
    \item Compares security performance based on testing a custom vulnerability-inclined dataset.
\end{enumerate}
The last experiment \textbf{E3} takes on research question 3 regarding how to best formulate the input for automatic smart contract code synthesis.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Smart contract downloader}
\label{sec:smart-contract-downloader}
\url{https://github.com/andstor/smart-contract-downloader}


The largest provider of verified \acrshortpl{sc} is Etherscan. This website provides a list of all verified \acrshortpl{sc} on the blockchain. More on their service...... Etherscan provides a API for downloading verified Smart Contracts. The API is available at \url{https://api.etherscan.io/api}.

In order to download the \acrshortpl{sc} from Etherscan, a tool we need to provide the \acrshortpl{sc} address. The address is the first part of the \acrshortpl{sc} code. The address is the first part of the \acrshortpl{sc} code.

The following code snippet is a Google BigQuery query. It will select all \acrshortpl{sc} addresses on the Ethereum blockchain that has at least one transaction. This query was run on the 1st of April 2022, and the result was downloaded as a CSV file, and is available at \url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/andstor/smart_contracts/blob/main/contract_addresses.csv}. The CSV file is then used to download the \acrshortpl{sc} from Etherscan.

\begin{lstlisting}[
    caption={Google BigQuery query for selecting all \acrlong{sc} addresses on Ethereum that has at least one transaction.},
    label=lst:reentrancy,
    language=SQL]
SELECT contracts.address, COUNT(1) AS tx_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.contracts` AS contracts
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions` AS transactions 
      ON (transactions.to_address = contracts.address)
GROUP BY contracts.address
ORDER BY tx_count DESC
}
\end{lstlisting}

\todo{Include img of the processing script output}
Saved to file for simple reestarrting, multiprocessing and parallelization.

The total number of files generated by the downloading program was 5,810,042. In order to efficiently process these, all files were combined into a tarfile. A processing script was then created for filtering out all "empty" files. These correspond to a contract address on Ethereum that has not been verified on Etherscan.io. A total of 3,592,350 files were empty, making the source code of 38,17\% of the deployed contracts on Ethereum available. Each non-empty file is then parsed and the contract data is extracted. This extraction process is rather complicated, as smart contract sources come in a wide variety of flavors and formats.

\subsubsection{Normalization}
The most common is a contract written the Solidity language with  a single contract "entry"  \todo{Find a better name for contract keyword}. However, a single contrract file can contain multtiple contracts, making use of properties like inheritance etc.. The source code contracts can also be split over multiple files, a formmat rreefered to as "Multi file". When compiling thtese, the source code files aree "flattened" into a single contract file before compiliattion. Anotther flavour is hte JSON format, which is a language that is used to describe the \acrshortpl{sc}. Here the sourcecode is structured in tthe in the JSON code. Smart contracts can also be vritten in the Vyper language. Vyper is .... \todo{explain vyper}.


\begin{lstlisting}[
    caption={Solidity standard JSON Input format.},
    label=lst:flattened-dataset-cmd,
    language=JSON]
{
    "sources": {/* ... */},
    "settings": {
        "optimizer": {/* ... */},
        "evmVersion": "<VERSION>"
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

All of the above formats are processed by the processing script, normalizing the contract source code to a single "flattened" contract file. The source code, along with the contract metadata, is then saved across multiple Parquet files, each consisting of 30000 "flattened" contracts. A total of 2,217,692 smart contracts were successfully parsed and normalized.

\subsubsection{Duplication filtering}
\label{sec:duplication-filtering}
A large quantity of Smart Contracts contains duplicated code. Primarily, this is due to the frequent use of library code, such as Safemath and ... \todo{Reference libraries}. Etherscan requires the library code used in a contract to be embedded in the source code. Filtering is applied to produce a dataset with a mostly unique contract source code to mitigate this. This filtering is done by calculating the string distance between the source code. Due to the rather large amount of contracts (\~2 million), the comparison is only made within groups of contracts. These groups are defined by grouping on the "contract\_name" for the \textit{flattened} dataset, and by "file\_name" for the \textit{inflated} dataset. These datasets will be discssed in detail in the following sections.

The actual code filtering is done by applying a token-based similarity algorithm named Jacard Index. The algorithm is computationally efficient and can be used to filter out \acrshortpl{sc} that are not similar to the query. The Jacard Index is a measure of the similarity between two sets. The Jacard Index is defined as the ratio of the size of the intersection to the size of the union of the two sets.


\subsection{Datasets}
\label{sec:datasets}
This section describes the datasets created in this study.

\subsubsection{Verified Smart Contracts}
\label{sec:verified-smart-contracts}
\url{https://github.com/andstor/verified-smart-contracts}
\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/andstor/smart_contracts}

The Verified Smart Contracts dataset is a dataset consisting of verified Smart Contracts from Etherscan.io. This is real smmart contracts that are deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. A set of 100,000 to 200,000 contracts are provided, containing both Solidity and Vyper code.

\cref{tab:verified-smart-contracts-metrics} shows the metrics of the various (sub)datasets.

\end{table}

LoC refers to the lines of source\_code. The Parsed dataset counts lines of func\_code + func\_documentation.

\paragraph{Raw}
\label{sec:verified-smart-contracts-raw}
The raw dataset contains mostly the raw data from Etherscan, downloaded with the smart-contract-downlader tool, as described in \cref{sec:smart-contract-downloader}. All different contract formats (JSON, multi-file, etc.) are normalized to a flattened source code structure. 

\todo{Add stats on the raw dataset}

\paragraph{Flattened}
\label{sec:verified-smart-contracts-flattened}

The flattened dataset is a filtered version  of the Raw dataset\cref{sec:verified-smart-contracts-raw}. It contains smart contracts, where every contract contains all required library code. Each "file" is marked in the source code with a comment stating the original file path: //File: path/to/file.sol. These are then filtered for uniqueness with a similarity threshold of 0.9. This means that all contracts whose code shares more than 90\% of the tokens will be discarded. The low uniqueness requirement is due to the often large amount of embedded library code. If the requirement is set to high, the actual contract code will be negligible compared to the library code. Most contracts will be discarded, and the resulting dataset would contain mostly unique library code. However, the dataset as a whole will have a large amount of duplicated libray code. From the 2,217,692 contracts, 2,080,723 duplications are found, giving a duplication percentage of 93.82\%. The resulting dataset consists of 136,969 contracts.

\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Inflated}
\label{sec:verified-smart-contracts-inflated}
The inflated dataset is also based on the raw dataset. Each contract file in the dataset is split into its original representative files. This mitigates a lot of the problems of the flattened dataset in terms of duplicated library code. The library code would, along with other imported contract files, be split into separate contract records. The 2,217,692 "raw" smart contracts are inflated to a total of 5,403,136 separate contract files. These are then grouped by "file\_name" and filtered for uniqueness with a similarity threshold of 0.9. This should produce a dataset with a large amount of unique source code, with low quantities of library code. A total of 5,216,739 duplications are found, giving a duplication percentage of 96.56\%. The resulting dataset consists of 186,397 contracts.

\section{Language Modeling}
\label{sec:language-modeling}
This chapter presents a detailed overview of the system architecture for generating secure Smart Contract code. The first section gives an overview of the GPT-J model architecture, followed by a section describing the pre-training of the model. The third section describes the fine-tuning process on the smart contract dataset presented in \cref{sec:verified-smart-contracts-inflated,sec:verified-smart-contracts-audit}. 

\todo{Add figure of training process}

\subsection{Pre-training}
\label{sec:pretraining}
In this project, pre-trained weights for GPT-J-6B from ElutherAI are used. The pre-training by ElutherAI is done on the dataset The Pile, described in \cref{sec:the-pile}. Of the roughly 825GiB, 95.16 GiB (7.59\%) of The Pile is code from GitHub. Compared to many other open-source models, GPT-J-6B is one of the most promising models for the task of code generation.

The specific GPT-J model configuration can be seen in \cref{tab:gpt-j-model-details}. In detail, GPT-J-6B consists of 28 layers with a model dimension of 4096, and a feedforward dimension of 16384. The model dimension is split into 16 heads, each with a dimension of 256. \acrfull{rope} is applied to 64 dimensions of each head. The model is trained with a tokenization vocabulary of 50257, using the same set of \acrfullpl{bpe} as GPT-2 and GPT-3. The weights of GPT-J-6B are licensed under version 2.0 of the Apache License.

\subsection{Fine-tuning}
\label{sec:fine-tuning}
To improve the pre-trained GPT-J-6B model's smart contract code generation performance, the model is fine-tuned on a dataset only containing real Ethereum Smart Contract code. Specifically, two models are created. The first model, named GPT-J-6B-Smart-Contract, is fine-tuned on the Verified Smart Contracts dataset \cref{sec:verified-smart-contracts}. The other model, named GPT-J-6B-Smart-Contract-Audit, is a secure version of the first model. It is fine-tuned on the Verified Smart Contracts Audit dataset \cref{sec:verified-smart-contracts-audit}, the same dataset as for the first model but with additional labeling from vulnerability analysis.

\subsection{Security Conditioning}
\label{sec:security-conditioning}
When training a large language model on several gigabytes of open-source code, it is safe to assume that large portions of this code are not safe and contains vulnerabilities. In the case of Smart Contracts, the vulnerability analysis presented in section \ref{sec:verified-smart-contracts} shows that almost 50\% of deployed Smart Contracts contain at least one high-severity vulnerability. This will result in a biased model that may produce a lot of vulnerable code. This section introduces a technique, named security conditioning, to reduce and mitigate this problem.

Vulnerability analysis is a difficult area. It is especially hard in the area of smart contracts, where the execution environment is not deterministic ????\todo{find correct wording.}... Previous works have tried to classify vulnerable code with large language models without much success \todo{Cite previous works}. In this project, instead of classifying vulnerable code, the goal is to make the model more secure by conditioning it on the presence of vulnerabilities.

The security conditioning is done by appending a special security label to each of the records in the training data. This way, the model can use this token(s) to condition whether to produce safe or vulnerable code. This requires the dataset to first be labeled as secure or vulnerable. For this project, SolidityDetector is used for labeling. Further details on the dataset construction can be found in \cref{sec:verified-smart-contracts-audit}.

\todo{Add example of security conditioning.}

\section{E2 - Security Conditioning}
\label{sec:e2-security-conditioning}
This section presents the results and discussion of the sub-experiments of experiment \textbf{E2}. Experiment \textbf{E2} focuses on the security of smart contract code generation, tackling research question 2. It compares the security of a fine-tuned model with and without utilizing security conditioning purposed in \cref{sec:security-conditioning}. The following three sub-experiments are all based on the same fine-tuned models, but uses different evaluation method.

\subsubsection{Method and Data}
Using security conditioning reduces the frequency of vulnerable code.

\subsubsection{Results and Discussion}
Include attenttion weightts of the model. And training results.

\label{sec:e2.1-complete-class-context}

\subsubsection{Method and Data}
\subsubsection{Results and Discussion}

No significant difference between the two models. In fact, it seems to be worse. ... It is, therefore, reasonable to hypothesize that this is due to the limited sample space available. The existing contract code provided as input context could be biased. This motivates the use of a smaller input context. This should increase the sample space and allow the model to make better use of the security conditioning. This hypothesis is the basis for Experiment E2.2.

\subsection{E2.2 - Comment Context}
\label{sec:e2.2-comment-context}

\subsubsection{Method and Data}

\subsubsection{Results and Discussion}
Still, no significant differences can be observed. Upon further inspection of the generated code (qualitative), most of the reported vulnerabilities are due to the generation of classes instead of functions. Another problem seems to be that the vulnerability detection tool is not able to detect the vulnerabilities in the generated code. Since the generated code is primarily confined to only one function, potential problematic code such as integer overflow needs an actual state variable in order to be classified as a vulnerability. Since this is not possible, it motivated the creation of a tailor-made evaluation dataset, and is the basis for Experiment E2.2.


\subsection{E2.3 - Inclined Vulnerabilities}
\label{sec:e2.3-inclined-vulnerabilities}
By using a custom made evaluation dataset, it can be hypotthesized that this more accurately capttures the behaviour of the system as it would be used in production.

\subsubsection{Method and Data}
For this experiment, a tailor-made evaluation dataset was created for the sole purpose of evaluating how secure the model is. The dataset is described in detail in \cref{sec:inclined-vulnerabilities}

\subsubsection{Results and Discussion}
Hopefully good results!!! If so, do statistical hypothesis testing to investigate the significance of the observation.

\textbf{\(H_0\)}: A model using security conditioning does not produce fewer vulnerabilities. 
\textbf{\(H_1\)}: A model using security conditioning produces fewer vulnerabilities.


\section{E3 - Formulation of Inputs}
\label{sec:e3-formulation-of-inputs}
For answering research question 3, this experiment focuses on the formulation of inputs to the model. Specifically, it investigates how comments can be constructed and formatted in order to generate the best possible code.

\subsubsection{Method and Data}
Clustering of data from verified smart contracts dataset. Elaborate... Select based on elbow method. From the clustered results, 10.000 random samples are selected from each of the clusters. These samples are used to generate code. The function's comment and the function's signature are used as input to the fine-tuned models. One with security conditioning and one withou. The results are then compared.

\section{Evaluation metrics}
\todo{Rewrite}
Accuracy could measure correctness of the exact match, failing, however, to capture the proximity when a completion suggestion partially matches the target sequence, which could still be a valid completion suggestion.

\todo{Rewrite}
The ROUGE score is the metric commonly used to evaluate machine translation models. Its ROUGE-L variant is based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) statistics. LCS takes into account structure similarity and identifies longest co-occurring n-grams.

\todo{Rewrite}
The Levenshtein distance measures how many single-character edits  including insertion, substitution, or deletion - does it take to transform one sequence of tokens to another. Quite often, even if a suggested completion is only an approximate match, developers are willing to accept it, making appropriate edits afterwards. As such, the Levenshtein edit similarity is a critical evaluation metric.


Get logits from a model  prediction to visualize the distribution of the predicted probabilities.

\section{Quantitative evaluation}

Even though only "HIH" severity vulnerabilities are labeled, several most of these also contain medium and low severity vulnerabilities. See Doughnut chart...  
The "full" context code is subject to latent vulnerabilities, which are unavoidable. Hence this could explain the low decrease in vulnerabilities.




\section{Qualitative evaluation}


\section{Memorisation evaluation}
Check if the model is just copying

Do this by investigating logits from  all layers.

Check common substrings in dattaset.

\section{Diff}
